Although theoretically rich, this work has yielded little consensus and led to numerous conceptual, measurement, and reproducibility issues. Social Safety Theory aims to address these issues by using the primary goal and regulatory logic of the human brain and immune system as the basis for specifying the social-environmental situations to which these systems should respond most strongly to maximize reproductive success and survival. This analysis gave rise to the integrated, multi-level formulation described herein, which transforms thinking about stress biology and provides a biologically based, evolutionary account for how and why experiences of social safety and social threat are strongly related to health, well-being, aging, and longevity. In doing so, the theory advances a testable framework for investigating the biopsychosocial roots of health disparities as well as how health-relevant biopsychosocial processes crystalize over time and how perceptions of the social environment interact with childhood microbial environment, birth cohort, culture, air pollution, genetics, sleep, diet, personality, and self-harm to affect health. The theory also highlights several interventions for reducing social threat and promoting resilience.',\n",

This study aimed to provide an overview of the evidence on the mediators, moderators, and implementation factors of SBMT, and propose a conceptual model that can be used both to summarize the evidence and provide a framework for future research. A scoping review was performed, and six databases and grey literature were searched. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select relevant material. Quantitative and qualitative information was extracted from eligible articles and reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search produced 5479 articles, of which 31 were eligible and included in the review. Eleven studies assessed moderators of SBMT on pupil outcomes, with mixed findings for all variables tested. Five studies examined the mediating effect of specific variables on pupil outcomes, with evidence that increases in mindfulness skills and decreases in cognitive reactivity and self-criticism post-intervention are related to better pupil outcomes at follow-up. Twenty-five studies assessed implementation factors. We discuss key methodological shortcomings of included studies and integrate our findings with existing implementation frameworks to propose a conceptual model. Widespread interest in universal SBMT has led to increased research over recent years, exploring who SBMT works for and how it might work, but the current evidence is limited.

This qualitative study aims to characterize the motivation and practices of counterfeit NPF pill initiation and use among individuals using illicit opioids in Arizona. Between October 2020 and May 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 individuals meeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) 18\\xa0years or older; (2) residence in Arizona; and (3) use of illicit opioids in the past 30\\xa0days and/or opioid use disorder treatment in the past 12\\xa0months. Participants were recruited through referrals by a harm reduction organization, craigslist ads, and referrals by other participants. Interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom. Qualitative interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo. Out of 22 participants, 64% were male, and 45% were ethnic minorities. Age ranged between 25 and 51\\xa0years old. Participants noted significant recent increases in the availability of counterfeit NPF pills (\"blues,\" \"dirty oxys\") that were most commonly used by smoking. The majority indicated first trying NPF pills in the past year, and the first use often occurred in situations of reduced access to heroin or pharmaceutical opioids. Participant decisions to switch over to more frequent NPF pill use or to maintain some levels of heroin use were shaped by local drug availability trends and personal experiences with NPF effects. They were also influenced by conflicting views of social acceptability of pharmaceutical-like drugs, perceived harms of NPF in terms of overdose risks and increased difficulty of quitting, and perceived benefits of switching to the non-injection route of opioid administration (e.g., from injecting heroin to smoking NPF pills). Our findings highlight the need for the implementation of novel policy, treatment, and harm reduction approaches to address the growing unpredictability of drug supply and NPF pill-specific risks, attitudes, and behaviors.',\n",

This article aims to identify potential bi-directional associations between climate change impacts and health-related behaviors, as well as a set of key actions for the behavioral medicine community. We synthesized the existing literature about (i) the impacts of rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air pollution, and rising sea level on individual behaviors (e.g., eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, substance use, and preventive care) as well as the structural factors related to these behaviors (e.g., the food system); and (ii) the concurrent positive and negative roles that health-related behaviors can play in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Based on this literature review, we propose a first conceptual model of climate change and health-related behavior feedback loops. Key actions are proposed, with particular consideration for health equity implications of future behavioral interventions. Actions to bridge the fields of behavioral medicine and climate sciences are also discussed. We contend that climate change is among the most urgent issues facing all scientists and should become a central priority for the behavioral medicine community.',\n",

However, given relatively recent implementation, the clinical impact of bridge clinics is not well described. In this narrative review, we describe existing bridge clinic models, services provided, and unique characteristics, highlighting how bridge clinics fill critical gaps in the SUD care continuum. We discuss available evidence for bridge clinic effectiveness in care delivery, including retention in SUD care. We also highlight gaps in available data. The first era of bridge clinic implementation has yielded diverse models united in the mission to lower barriers to SUD treatment entry, and preliminary data indicate success in patient-centered program design, MOUD initiation, MOUD retention, and SUD care innovation. However, data on effectiveness in linking to long-term care are limited. Bridge clinics represent a critical innovation, offering on-demand access to MOUD and other services. Evaluating the effectiveness of bridge clinics in linking patients to long-term care settings remains an important research priority; however, available data show promising rates of treatment initiation and retention, potentially the most important metric amidst an increasingly dangerous drug supply.',\n",

Participants (n\\u2009=\\u200930) were people who injected heroin/fentanyl also using methamphetamine who participated in semi-structured interviews. We found multiple methods of co-using opioids and methamphetamine, whether alternately or simultaneously and in varying order. Most prioritized opioids, with motives for using methamphetamine forming three thematic categories: 'intrinsic use', encompassing both inherent pleasure of combined use greater than using both drugs separately or for self-medication of particular conditions; 'opioid assisting use' in which methamphetamine helped people manage their existing heroin/fentanyl use; and 'reluctant or indifferent use' for social participation, reflecting methamphetamine's low cost and easy availability. Methamphetamine serves multiple functions among people using opioids in WV. Beliefs persist that methamphetamine can play a role in preventing and reversing opioid overdose, including some arguments for sequential use being protective of overdose.

Therefore, a hypothetical model was tested to examine the relationships between basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life. Data were collected from a sample of 546 participants. Mediation analysis was conducted, and the results indicated that basic psychological needs, online gaming addiction, responsibility, and meaning in life had significant negative and positive relationships. The findings indicated that responsibility and meaning in life had a serial mediating effect in the relationship between basic psychological needs and online gaming addiction.

Repeated measures ANOVAs showed that HateLess was successful, as there was a significant increase in empathy, self-efficacy, and counter-speech in the intervention group from the pretest (T1) to the posttest (T2) one month after the intervention. In contrast, no changes were found among adolescents in the control group. A multilevel mediation model revealed that the effect of being a member of the intervention group on counter-speech was partially mediated via empathy and self-efficacy. The findings indicate that HateLess is an effective, cost-efficient approach to enhance adolescents\\' counter-speech directly and indirectly by altering the skills they need to become informed citizens in democratic societies.',\n",

Filling this research gap, this study investigated if academic self-efficacy mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological distress at the intraindividual level during 3 years of upper secondary school. Gender moderation was also examined in the hypothesised model. The present sample consisted of 1508 Norwegian adolescents (baseline M age\\u2009=\\u200916.42; 52.9% high perceived family wealth; 70.6% Norwegian-born). The random intercept cross-lagged panel model results indicated (1) positive and time-invariant direct effects from academic stress to psychological distress, (2) academic self-efficacy partially mediated these effects, and (3) psychological distress impacted later academic stress. Academic stress was more strongly related to academic self-efficacy and psychological distress at the interpersonal level for boys, while the intraindividual impact of academic stress on psychological distress was stronger for girls. The study findings might have implications for school-based implementation strategies and theoretical development.',\n",

Injection frequency has increased as a result and so has equipment sharing and health-related risks. The aim of this analysis was to explore the impact of safer supply programs on injection practices from the perspective of clients and providers in Ontario, Canada. The data set included qualitative interviews with 52 clients and 21 providers that were conducted between February and October 2021 across four safer supply programs. Interview excerpts discussing injection practices were extracted, screened, coded and then grouped into themes. We identified three themes, each theme corresponding to a change in injection practices. The first change was a decrease in the amount of fentanyl used and a decrease in injection frequency. The second change involved switching to injecting hydromorphone tablets instead of fentanyl. Finally, the third change was stopping injecting altogether and taking safer supply medications orally. Safer supply programs can contribute to reducing injection-related health risks in addition to overdose risks. More specifically, they have the potential to address disease prevention and health promotion gaps that stand-alone downstream harm reduction interventions cannot address, by working upstream and providing a safer alternative to fentanyl.',\n",

Transcribed interviews were analyzed to identify barriers to accessing HIV prevention services among PWID using the risk environment framework. Participants identified numerous political, physical, social, and economic community-level barriers that influenced access to HIV prevention services among PWID. Political factors included low community support for syringe services programs (SSPs); physical factors included low SSP coverage, low coverage of HIV testing outreach events, low HIV preexposure prophylaxis availability, and homelessness; social factors included stigma and discrimination; economic factors included community beliefs that SSPs negatively affect economic investments and limited resources for HIV screening in clinical settings.

We also use data from the US Current Population Survey to estimate linear probability regressions for the likelihood of pandemic-related remote work among workers with and without disabilities. Findings indicate that women, Hispanic people, sexual and gender minorities, individuals without 4-year college degrees, and people with preexisting disabilities are more likely to have long COVID and to have activity limitations from long COVID. Remote work is a reasonable arrangement for people with such activity limitations and may be an unintentional accommodation for some people who have undisclosed disabilities. However, this study shows that people with disabilities were less likely than people without disabilities to perform pandemic-related remote work. The data suggest this disparity persists because people with disabilities are clustered in jobs that are not amenable to remote work. Employers need to consider other accommodations, especially shorter workdays and flexible scheduling, to hire and retain employees who are struggling with the impacts of long COVID.',\n",

We used longitudinal data on self-reported compliance from 50,851 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected across two waves of the pandemic in the UK (April 01, 2020-February 22, 2021). We modeled typical compliance trajectories using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and used multinomial logistic regression to examine whether individual personality and demographic characteristics were related to compliance trajectories. We selected a four-class LCGA solution. Most individuals maintained high levels of compliance and reported similar levels of compliance across the first and second waves. Approximately 15% of participants had decreasing levels of compliance across the pandemic, reporting noticeably lower levels of compliance in the second wave. Individuals with declining compliance levels were younger on average, in better physical health, had lower empathy and conscientiousness and greater general willingness to take risks. While a minority, not all individuals have maintained high compliance across the pandemic. Decreasing compliance is related to several psychological traits.

The WHO\\'s definition of health implies that many people with chronic illnesses or disabilities would be considered unhealthy and complete wellbeing would be utopian and unfeasible for them. This is no longer uniformly accepted. Many alternative concepts of health have been discussed in the last decades such as \\'positive health\\', which focusses on someone\\'s capability rather than incapability,. However, the question remains whether a general health concept can guide all healthcare practices. More likely, health concepts need to be specified for professions or settings. The objective of our study was to create a structured overview of published concepts of health from different perspectives by conducting a scoping review using the PRISMA-ScR guideline. A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Cinahl. Articles eligible for inclusion focussed on the discussion or the conceptualisation of health or health-related concepts in different contexts (such as the perspective of care workers\\' or patients\\') published since 2009 (the Dutch Health Council raised the discussion about moving towards a more dynamic perspective on health in that year). Seventy-five articles could be included for thematic analyses. The results showed that most articles described a concept of health consisting of multiple subthemes; no consensus was found on one overall concept of health. This implies that healthcare consumers act based on different health concepts when seeking care than care workers when providing care. Having different understandings of the concepts of health can lead to misunderstandings in practice. In conclusion, from every perspective, and even for every individual, health may mean something different. This finding stresses the importance that care workers\\' and healthcare consumers\\' meaning of \\'health\\' has to be clear to all actors involved. Our review supports a more uniform tuning of healthcare between healthcare providers (the organisations), care workers (the professionals) and healthcare consumers (the patients), by creating more awareness of the differences among these actors, which can be a guide in their communication.',\n",

In-depth interviews were conducted with 35 key informants in North America who deemed themselves experts in new psychoactive substances, and identified as drug checkers, sellers, or experienced users. Interviews were coded in an inductive manner, and we conducted thematic analysis to identify relevant themes. We identified four main themes focusing on festival attendance as a risk factor for risky drug use and related outcomes: attendees inexperienced with electronic dance music parties and party drugs, risky drug purchasing, risky drug use practices, and festival-specific environmental risk factors. Festivals attract a wide array of people not experienced with party drugs, yet drugs like ecstasy are commonly sought by such individuals inside festivals. Relying on strangers inside to purchase drugs is a risk factor for purchasing adulterated product. Fear of security/police at festivals leads to risky drug-taking such as ingesting one's full batch of drugs at the entrance. These risks are compounded by environmental factors including crowding, hot temperature, and lack of water (which lead to dehydration), long/consecutive event days (which can lead to exhaustion), and inadequate medical emergency response.

Notably, associations between parental use of active mediation and youth's amount of Internet use and leisure-related use varied based on parenting style profiles.

We also investigate if factors have a negative, positive or no effect. We report in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In a review of 47 studies, we find 32 factors. Most of these factors are barriers. The most frequently mentioned barriers\\xa0are employers' (1) expectations that people with disabilities are\\xa0unproductive, (2) expectations that people with disabilities cost a lot of money, and employers' (3) lack\\xa0of knowledge about disabilities. The most researched facilitators for employers to hire people with disabilities include (1) the motivation to help others, (2) working in a large organization, and (3) expecting a competitive advantage. The effect of factors\\xa0can differ\\xa0depending on contextual circumstances, including the type\\xa0of organization, the type of disability and different policies. We conclude that hiring decisions are influenced by an array of different barriers and facilitators. The effect of these factors can differ across organizations and disability types. Our study of factors affecting hiring can be used by scholars, policy makers, and organizations to create interventions to increase the hiring of people with disabilities.\",\n",
       " 'W4319655556': 'The ultimate goal of our public health system is to reduce the incidence of disability and premature death. Evidence suggests that, by this standard, the USA falls behind most other developed countries largely as a function of disparities in health outcomes among significant portions of the US population. We present a framework for addressing these disparities that attributes them, not simply to differences in the behavioral and physical risk factors, but to social, environmental, and structural inequities such as poverty, discrimination, toxic physical setting, and the marketing of harmful products. These inequities result from de facto and instituted public policies. An analysis of the NIH research portfolio indicates a relative lack of investment in experimental evaluations of preventive interventions-especially studies targeting disadvantaged populations. Moreover, experimental research on reducing social inequities is almost entirely lacking. A line of research focusing on the drivers of inequities and their dissolution must include experimental evaluation of strategies for getting policies adopted that will reduce inequities. In conclusion, a summary is provided of the types of research that are needed and the challenges involved in conducting the experimental research that is essential for reducing inequities and disparities and, in turn, prolonging life.',\n",

However, many groups (e.g., people with low income levels, people who are geographically isolated, older adults) may face obstacles to technology access and use. In addition, research has found that biases and stereotypes can be embedded within digital health interventions. As such, behavioral digital health interventions that intend to improve overall population health may unintentionally widen health-related inequities. This commentary offers guidance and strategies to mitigate these risks when using technology as a means for delivering a behavioral health intervention. A collaborative working group from Society of Behavioral Medicine's Health Equity Special Interest Group developed a framework to center equity in the development, testing and dissemination of behavioral digital health interventions. We introduce Partner, Identify, Demonstrate, Access, Report (PIDAR), a 5-point framework to avoid the creation, perpetuation, and/or widening of health inequities in behavioral digital health work. It is critically important to prioritize equity when conducting digital health research. The PIDAR framework can serve as a guide for behavioral scientists, clinicians and developers. Behavioral digital health interventions have great potential to improve health. Unfortunately, many groups (e.g., people with low-income levels, people who are geographically isolated, older adults) may face significant obstacles to technology access, adoption and use.

       " 'W4381848430': 'Public policies have been essential in addressing many of the most pressing public health problems in the USA and around the world. A large and convincing body of multidisciplinary research has established the impacts or effectiveness of public policies, such as smoke-free air laws and nutrition standards, on improving health outcomes and behaviors. Most of this research assumes that because an evidence-based policy is adopted or takes effect, it is implemented as intended. This assumption, however, is often incorrect. Like with clinical guidelines and other interventions, implementation science has an important role to play in promoting the uptake and implementation of evidence-based public policies that promote public health. To realize this potential, there remains a critical need to first establish a common understanding of what public policy is, the role of specific policies in the context of implementation (i.e., is it the evidence-based intervention or the implementation strategy?), and to establish an appropriate methodological foundation for the field of policy implementation science. We recommend that the field must evolve to (i) include policy experts and actors on policy implementation science study teams; (ii) identify theories, models, and frameworks that are suitable for policy implementation science; (iii) identify policy implementation strategies; (iv) adapt and/or identify study designs best suited for policy implementation science research; and (v) identify appropriate policy implementation outcome measures. Public policies are important to promote the health and well-being of the public. Many important health advances have been made because of policies designed to prevent or limit unhealthy behaviors (such as smoke-free laws) and promote access to medical care (such as health insurance mandates). However, just because a policy is “on the books” does not mean that it is implemented or implemented as intended. To improve how researchers study policy implementation, we discuss some challenges in the field, provide a call to action for researchers to continue developing the field of policy implementation science, and we recommend that scientists establish partnerships with experts in public policy and work together to develop scientific methods that will do a better job of putting policy into practice.',\n",

The aim of this study was to examine what drives increases in opioid overdose death among Black Americans based on the experience of key stakeholders. Focus groups were conducted with stakeholders providing substance use prevention services in Black communities in St. Louis, MO (n\\u2009=\\u200914). One focus group included peer advocates and volunteers conducting outreach-based services and one included active community health workers. Focus groups were held at community partner organizations familiar to participants. Data collection was facilitated by an interview guide with open-ended prompts. Focus groups were audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to abstract line-by-line codes into higher order themes and interpret their associations. A core theme was identified from participants' narratives suggesting that opioid overdose death among Black individuals is driven by unmet needs for safety, security, stability, and survival (The 4Ss). A lack of The 4Ss was reflective of structural disinvestment and healthcare and social service barriers perpetuated by systemic racism. Participants unmet 4S needs are associated with health and social consequences that perpetuate overdose and detrimentally impact recovery efforts. Participants identified cultural and relationship-based strategies that may address The 4Ss and mitigate overdose in Black communities. Key stakeholders working in local communities to address racial inequities in opioid overdose highlighted the importance of upstream interventions that promote basic socioeconomic needs. Local outreach efforts utilizing peer services can provide culturally congruent interventions and promote harm reduction in Black communities traditionally underserved by US health and social systems.\",\n",

Research on the acceptability of LAART for this age-group is limited. We asked 953 AYLHIV about their preferred (theoretical) ART mode of delivery (pill, injectable, or other) in 2017-2018, before LAART was available or known to AYLHIV in South Africa. One in eight (12%) AYLHIV preferred LAART over single or multiple pill regimens.

In marginal effects modelling, 66% of adolescents who experienced all factors were likely to prefer LAART, highlighting the potential high acceptability of LAART among adolescents and young people living with HIV struggling to adhere and have good HIV treatment outcomes. Adolescent boys who reported high ART pill burden were more likely to prefer LAART than their female peers in moderation analyses, suggesting that LAART may be particularly important to improve treatment outcomes among male AYLHIV as they become older. Adding LAART to existing treatment options for AYLHIV, particularly higher risk groups, would support AYLHIV to attain and sustain viral suppression-the third 95, and reduce their risk of AIDS-related mortality.

En la modelización de efectos marginales, el 66% de los adolescentes que experimentaron todos los factores eran propensos a preferir la TAR LA, lo que pone de relieve la alta aceptabilidad potencial de la TAR LA entre los adolescentes y los jóvenes que viven con el VIH que luchan por adherirse y tener buenos resultados en el tratamiento del VIH. Los adolescentes varones que informaron de una alta carga de píldoras para el tratamiento antirretroviral eran más propensos a preferir la TAR LA que sus pares mujeres en los análisis de moderación, lo que sugiere que la TAR LA puede ser particularmente importante para mejorar los resultados del tratamiento entre los hombres que viven con el VIH a medida que crecen.

Two evaluators completed semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis informed to identify key themes. Four key interrelated themes emerged, including the acceptability of naloxone kit inserts to promote VOMS, best practices for implementation, key messaging to include within promotional materials and facilitators to dissemination of harm reduction material. Participants highlighted that messaging should be promoted both inside and outside the kits, should be concise, provide basic information about VOMS and can be facilitated through current distribution streams. Messaging could further be used to draw attention to local harm reduction services and could be promoted on other supplies, including lighters and safer consumption supplies. Findings demonstrate that it is acceptable to promote VOMS within naloxone kits and highlight interviewees preferred ways to do so. Key themes that emerged from interviewees can be used to inform the dissemination of harm reduction information, including VOMS and bolster current strategies for reducing illicit drug overdose.',\n",

Perspectives of PWID treated in innovative models can reveal program features that address barriers to treatment, and guide implementation of similar models. We interviewed 29 participants in the intervention arm of a randomized trial. The trial enrolled PWID with HCV in New York City from 2017 to 2020 and tested the effectiveness of a low-threshold HCV treatment model at a syringe services program. Participants were purposively sampled and interviewed in English or Spanish. The interview guide focused on prior experiences with HCV testing and treatment, and experiences during the trial. Interviews were inductively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Before enrollment, participants reported being tested for HCV in settings such as prison, drug treatment, and emergency rooms. Treatment was delayed because of not being seen as urgent by providers. Participants reported low self-efficacy, competing priorities, and systemic barriers to treatment such as insurance, waiting lists, and criminal-legal interactions. Stigma was a major factor. Treatment during the trial was facilitated through respect from staff, which overcame stigma. The flexible care model (allowing walk-ins and missed appointments) helped mitigate logistical barriers. The willingness of the staff to address social determinants of health was highly valued. Our findings highlight the need for low-threshold programs with nonjudgmental behavior from program staff, and flexibility to adapt to participants' needs. Social determinants of health remain a significant barrier, but programs' efforts to address these factors can engender trust and facilitate treatment. Trial registration NCT03214679.\",\n",

In 2020, 83% of opioid-related overdose deaths were due to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. Drug checking services have been widely implemented as a harm reduction intervention to facilitate the identification of substances in a drug sample. There is a need to inform decision-making on drug checking technologies and service implementation. This research aims to outline contextual considerations for the implementation of a drug checking service. A scoping review was conducted using a structured search strategy in PubMed and EMBASE. Articles were independently screened by two reviewers, and included if they were primary literature and reported on an actionable consideration(s) for drug checking services. Data elements were extracted using a standardized form, and included study design, study population, drug checking technology utilized or discussed, and main findings. Twenty-nine articles were selected for inclusion, and four primary areas of consideration were identified: drug checking technologies, venue of a drug checking service, legality, and privacy. Technological considerations include the need for highly accurate, quantitative results which appeal to both populations of people with drug use disorder and recreational users. Accessibility of services was identified as an important factor that may be impacted by the location, integration with other services, how the service is provided (mobile vs. fixed), and the hours of operation. Maintaining plausible deniability and building trust were seen as important facilitators to service use and engagement. Issues surrounding legality were the most frequently cited barrier by patrons, including fear of criminalization, policing, and surveillance. Patrons and stakeholders identified a need for supportive policies that offer protections. Maintaining anonymity for patrons is crucial to addressing privacy-related barriers. This review highlights the need to understand the local population and climate for drug checking to implement a drug checking service successfully. Common themes identified in the literature included considerations related to the choice of technology, the type of venue, and the impact of legality and privacy. We intend to utilize these considerations in future research to help guide discussions with US-based stakeholders.',\n",

This study examines barriers to retention in methadone treatment in a small Midwest community and identifies factors associated with greater endorsement of barriers. Patients at an opioid treatment program (N\\u2009=\\u2009267) were recruited to complete a computer-based survey onsite. Surveys assessed demographics, opioid misuse, depression and anxiety symptoms, trauma history and symptoms, social support, and barriers to retention in treatment (e.g., childcare, work, housing, transportation, legal obligations, cost, health). Descriptive statistics were used to examine individual barriers and multiple regression was calculated to identify demographic and psychosocial factors associated with greater cumulative barriers. Most participants reported at least one barrier to retention in treatment and more than half reported multiple barriers. Travel hardships and work conflicts were the most highly endorsed barriers. Past year return to use (B\\u2009=\\u20092.31, p\\u2009=\\u20090.004) and more severe mental health symptomology (B\\u2009=\\u20090.20, p\\u2009=\\u20090.038) were associated with greater cumulative barriers.

Individuals with past year return to use reported a greater number of barriers, highlighting the time following return to use as critical for wraparound services and support. Those with co-occurring mental health issues may be vulnerable to poor treatment outcomes, as evidenced by greater endorsement of barriers.

This context also creates the conditions necessary for skills transfer and diffusion of the intervention into social networks. Stigma and negative attitudes held by first responders and stakeholders involved in the implementation process, such as police or GPs, can prohibit the bystander response by inducing fear in responding. This interferes with skills transfer, naloxone use and carriage of naloxone kits. The findings provide theoretically informed guidance regarding the harm reduction\\xa0contexts that\\xa0are essential for the successful implementation of naloxone-based interventions. Peer-to-peer models of training are helpful as it reinforces social identity and successful skills transfer between bystanders. Health systems may want to assess the prevalence of, and take steps to\\xa0reduce opioid-related stigma with key stakeholders in contexts using a low threshold training approach to build an environment \\xa0to support positive naloxone outcomes.

Findings supported the persuasive benefits of the self-persuasion narrative compared to the narrative without self-persuasion, actual self-persuasion, and the irrelevant message. Its advantage over the narrative without self-persuasion was mediated by increased self-referencing, affective empathy, and perceived similarity with the character.

In addition to legal, policy and health system barriers, PWID may be hesitant to engage in HIV, treatment and care due to lack of knowledge, distrust of the health care system, and stigma related to their dual\\xa0drug use and HIV status. Implementation of formal peer support initiatives may reduce provider- and individual-level barriers and increase testing, linkage to, and engagement in HIV care among\\xa0people who use drugs. We conducted a community-led qualitative study to explore the impacts of peer support for people who inject drugs on HIV care access and engagement in Indonesia. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 participants in Jakarta and Bandung. Thematic analysis was used to explore how people who inject drugs living with HIV (PWID LHIV) (n\\u2009=\\u20098), peer support workers (n\\u2009=\\u20096), and service providers (n\\u2009=\\u20096) perceived peer support provision by non-governmental organisations. Participants unanimously described peer support as beneficial. Peer support workers were widely credited with facilitating access to HIV testing, referral to care, uptake of and adherence to antiretroviral treatment, as well as sustaining engagement in care for PWID. Support mechanisms that facilitated positive peer experiences included provision of HIV knowledge and awareness, emotional support, help with navigating complex bureaucracy, developing trust in health care services, enhancing confidence and motivation, and supporting peers to navigate a wide range of health and social welfare services beyond HIV-related care. Findings indicate that peer support can enhance access to testing, linkage to, and engagement in HIV care for people who use drugs living with HIV in Indonesia. In a context of an ongoing HIV epidemic among people who use drugs, reduced funding and policy attention to HIV and harm reduction, there is an urgent need to prioritize peer support interventions to identify people who use drugs facing health risks and link them to appropriate services.',\n",

SB 273 was enacted during a time when physician arrests and convictions had been increasing for years and were becoming more prevalent and more publicized. This study aims to better understand the impact of the legislation on patients and providers. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with opioid-prescribing primary care physicians and specialists practicing throughout West Virginia. Four themes emerged, 1. Fear of disciplinary action, 2. Exacerbation of opioid prescribing fear due to restrictive legislation, 3. Care shifts and treatment gaps, and 4. Conversion to illicit substances. The clinicians recognized the harms of inappropriate prescribing and how this could affect their patients. Decreases in opioid prescribing were already occurring prior to the law implementation. Disciplinary actions against opioid prescribers resulted in prescriber fear, which was then exacerbated by SB 273 and contributed to shifts in care that led to forced tapering and opioid under-prescribing.\\xa0Providers felt that taking on patients who legitimately required opioids could jeopardize their career. A holistic and patient-centered approach should be taken by legislative and disciplinary bodies to ensure patients are not abandoned when disciplinary actions are taken against prescribers or new legislation is passed.',\n",

Peer ratings of classmates were used to categorize students to five different bullying-related roles (criterion: >1\\u2009SD): bully, victim, bully-victim, defender, and non-participant. Student ratings of teachers were used to obtain class-level measures of teacher interventions: non-intervention, disciplinary sanctions, group discussion, and mediation/victim support. Controlling for student- and class-level background variables, two multilevel multinomial logistic regression analyses were computed to predict students' bullying-related roles at wave 2. In the static model, predictors were teacher interventions at wave 1, and in the dynamic model, predictors were teacher intervention changes across time. The static model showed that disciplinary sanctions reduced the likelihood of being a bully or victim, and group discussion raised the likelihood of being a defender. Mediation/victim support raised the likelihood of being a bully. The dynamic model complemented these results by indicating that increases in group discussion across time raised the likelihood of being a defender, whereas increases in non-intervention across time raised the likelihood of being a victim and reduced the likelihood of being a defender.

Few individuals with AUD receive guideline-based care in the form of screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment, or prescription of pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention. We interviewed clinicians across Alberta to assess the current experience and perceived barriers to managing AUD in people who have cirrhosis. The aim of this paper is to summarize these findings to inform the development of an educational intervention. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to explore the experiences of clinicians who care for patients with cirrhosis and AUD in Alberta. We conducted semi-structured interviews directed by an interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach whereby transcripts were coded, with codes grouped into larger categories, then themes. Sixteen clinicians participated in this study. Many participants acknowledged that they do not use a standardized approach to screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment. Through thematic analysis we identified four themes surrounding barriers to managing AUD in patients with cirrhosis: (i) Practicing within knowledge constraints, (ii) Navigating limited resources and system challenges, (iii) Balancing the complexity of cirrhosis and AUD, and (iv) Acknowledging the influence of provider perceptions on care. This article presents the perspectives of clinicians who care for people who have AUD and cirrhosis.

Descriptive analyses were used to describe the control variables and the differences between the work stressors of general HSS and eldercare employees. After this, multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed the association between work stressors and work ability. Eldercare employees experienced more often moral distress than HSS employees in general, and this further lowers their work ability. Single work stressors--Karasek's strain, Siegrist's ERI, organizational injustice and moral distress--increased the odds of low work ability (OR range 1.4-2.5) in comparison to no work stressors. However, the association with single stressors was roughly one third of that with the accumulation of all four work stressors (OR\\u2009=\\u20096.8). Thus, the accumulation of several stressors was most harmful for work ability. This study provides novel information on the accumulation of work stressors in relation to work ability.

We conducted a qualitative study to describe provider perspectives on the implementation of a harm reduction in-reach program. We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with providers from three different primary work sites within a safety net hospital in Boston, MA, in 2021. Interviews explored perceived facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the harm reduction in-reach program in the hospital setting and solicited recommendations for potential improvements to the harm reduction in-reach program. Interviews were analyzed using an inductive approach that incorporated principles of grounded theory methodology to identify prevailing themes. Twenty-four participants were interviewed from the harm reduction in-reach program, inpatient addiction consult service, and the hospital observation unit. Thematic analysis revealed seven major themes and multiple facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the harm reduction in-reach program. Participants highlighted the impact of power differences within the medical hierarchy on inter-team communication and clinical care, the persistence of addiction-related stigma, the importance of coordination and role delineation between care team members, and the benefits of a streamlined referral process.

The mediation analysis found that the changes in anxiety and depression were the mediators in the associations between non-motor experience and HRQOL; while only the changes in depression were found to be the mediator in the relationship between motor experience and HRQOL. Yoga is superior to conventional stretching exercises in improving nonmotor and motor symptoms in daily living. Reduced anxiety and depression play a role in mediating the positive effects of the mindfulness yoga intervention.

Results from logistic regressions suggest Latino and Black people were less likely to be vaccinated. People that did not have health insurance, a primary care doctor and were unemployed were more than 30% less likely to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Greater perceived health inequalities in one's neighborhood and perceived racial/ethnic discrimination were associated with a decreased odds in being vaccinated. People that suffered the loss of a household member from COVID-19 were three times more likely to have been vaccinated. Establishing policies that will increase access to health insurance and create jobs with living wages may have lasting impacts.

There is a lack of step-by-step methodological guidance for harmonizing disparate measures of latent constructs differently conceptualized or operationalized across studies, such as social, emotional, and behavioral constructs often utilized in prevention science. The current paper addressed this gap by providing methodological guidance and a case illustration focused on harmonizing measures of disparately conceptualized and operationalized constructs. We do so by outlining a five-phased harmonization approach paired with an illustrative example of the approach as applied to harmonization of broadband latent emotional and behavioral health constructs assessed with different measures across studies. This approach builds on and expands upon procedures currently recommended in the IDA literature with parallels to best practices in test development procedures. The illustrative example of our phased approach is drawn from an IDA study of 11 randomized controlled trials of Coping Power (Lochman & Wells, 2004), an evidence-based preventive intervention. We demonstrate the harmonization of two constructs, internalizing and externalizing problems, as harmonized across the teacher-reported scales of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (Achenbach, 1991a) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004).

The main themes described the experiences during the 24\\xa0h following release, reacclimating and navigating re-entry barriers, and re-entry preparedness and planning. Participants noted the initial 24\\xa0h to be a period of risk for returning to substance use or an opportunity to engage with OUD treatment as well as a tenuous period where many lacked basic resources such as shelter or money.

Participants overall described feeling unprepared for release and suggested improvements including formal transition programs, improved education, and support to combat the risk of overdose and return to substance use after incarceration. In this study that qualitatively examines the experiences of people with incarceration histories and OUD enrolled in methadone treatment, we found that participants faced many barriers to community re-entry, particularly surrounding basic resources and treatment engagement.

To combat this rise, clinicians and policymakers need to know which risk factors matter most in predicting poor adolescent mental health. Theory-driven research has identified numerous risk factors that predict adolescent mental health problems but has difficulty distilling and replicating these findings. Data-driven machine learning methods can distill risk factors and replicate findings but have difficulty interpreting findings because these methods are atheoretical. This study demonstrates how data- and theory-driven methods can be integrated to identify the most important preadolescent risk factors in predicting adolescent mental health. Machine learning models examined which of 79 variables assessed at age 10 were the most important predictors of adolescent mental health at ages 13 and 17. These models were examined in a sample of 1176 families with adolescents from nine nations. Machine learning models accurately classified 78% of adolescents who were above-median in age 13 internalizing behavior, 77.3% who were above-median in age 13 externalizing behavior, 73.2% who were above-median in age 17 externalizing behavior, and 60.6% who were above-median in age 17 internalizing behavior. Age 10 measures of youth externalizing and internalizing behavior were the most important predictors of age 13 and 17 externalizing/internalizing behavior, followed by family context variables, parenting behaviors, individual child characteristics, and finally neighborhood and cultural variables. The combination of theoretical and machine-learning models strengthens both approaches and accurately predicts which adolescents demonstrate above average mental health difficulties in approximately 7 of 10 adolescents 3-7 years after the data used in machine learning models were collected.',\n",

A sample of 639 veterans enrolled in EVP between May, 2015 and December, 2017 provided data to conduct descriptive analyses to assess participant demographics, graduation, and satisfaction rates. PRO data were analyzed using a within-participants pre-post design, and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine pre-post changes in PRO. Of 639 participants, 444 (69.48%) graduated EVP.

Although prior research has accumulated robust evidence of the average effects of universal SEL, it remains unclear whether it works similarly or differentially across diverse sociocultural subgroups of students. Investigating subgroup effects has implications for understanding the impact of universal SEL on possible subgroup disparities in student social-emotional competence (SEC). This study examined whether the effects of a universal SEL program on student SEC development differed across diverse student subgroups classified by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability status, and English learner status. Data came from student SEC progress monitoring collected during a 1-year quasi-experimental study of a universal SEL program (N\\u2009=\\u20091592; Grades K-2). The results of multigroup latent growth modeling suggest that (a) the intervention effects were slightly larger for Black students, compared to White or other racial-ethnic subgroups, and (b) the effects were not different across other examined subgroups. This study also found that in the comparison condition, the SEC disparities between Black and White students tended to widen throughout the year, whereas in the intervention condition, Black students showed a similar rate of growth as their White peers. Findings suggest that universal SEL may be similarly beneficial across many diverse student subgroups, while it may yield larger benefits among some racially marginalized subgroups, preventing racial disparities from further widening. Yet the benefits of SEL may not be sufficient to reduce existing subgroup disparities. These findings suggest a need for more studies to examine differential effects of universal preventive programs by diverse subgroups to better inform practices that enhance equity in youth outcomes.',\n",

The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (i.e., the MacArthur ladder) is the most widely used measure of this construct, but it remains unclear what exactly the MacArthur ladder measures. The present research sought to explore the social and economic factors that underlie responses to the MacArthur ladder and its relationship to health. We investigated this issue by examining the relationship between scores on the MacArthur ladder and measures of economic circumstances and noneconomic social status, as well as health and well-being measures, in healthy adults in the USA. In three studies (total N = 1,310) we found evidence that economic circumstances and social status are distinct constructs that have distinct associations with scores on the MacArthur ladder. We found that both factors exhibit distinct associations with measures of health and well-being and accounted for the association between the MacArthur ladder and each measure of health and well-being. Our findings suggest that the MacArthur ladder's robust predictive validity may result from the fact that it measures two factors-economic circumstances and social status-that are each independently associated with health outcomes. These findings provide a novel perspective on the large body of literature that uses the MacArthur ladder and suggests health researchers should do more to disentangle the social and economic aspects of subjective socioeconomic status. Past research has found that people’s subjective perception of their own socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with their health and well-being, even after controlling for traditional measures of SES such as income. But researchers still do not know why. One possibility is that subjective SES is simply a different measure of SES. Another is that it measures social status, separate from economic circumstances. We investigated this question using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, which measures how people see their place in society. Across three studies using 1,300 adults in the USA, we found that the MacArthur Ladder measures two distinct factors: (i) economic circumstances, as measured by their income, education, housing, etc. and (ii) social status as measured by relative judgements of power, control, social influence, and their standing in their community and society. Both of these aspects of SES uniquely predict health and well-being. Our investigation demonstrates that the MacArthur ladder is good at predicting health outcomes because it measures both economic circumstances and social status. This new insight can help health researchers better understand the effects of social and economic factors on health, and to measure them more precisely.\",\n",

Such approaches limit the spread of infections and reduce opioid overdose mortality. These policies have led to the opening of specialized structures located mainly in big cities and urbanized zones. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to HR structures in locations undergoing lockdown. Before the pandemic, HR services in France and in the USA were complemented by the development of remote HR programs: HaRePo (Harm Reduction by Post) for France, implemented in 2011, and NEXT Distro for the USA founded in 2017. These programs are free and specifically designed for people who have difficulties accessing HR tools and counseling in-person. PWUD can access HaRePo program by phone and/or email.

The aim of the study is to test if and possibly how COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have impacted the HR services in both countries. By using t-test comparing the year 2019 with the year 2020, we analyzed how lockdowns impacted the number of new users entering the programs, as well as the numbers of parcels sent and naloxone distributed, by using records of both structures. We showed that the activity of both programs was significantly impacted by the pandemic.

It shows that remote HR was able to partially compensate for the reduced HR activities due to COVID-19. We also observed that the distribution of naloxone per parcel tends to increase for both structures. With the ability to reach PWUD remotely, HaRePo and NEXT Distro were particularly effective at maintaining service continuity and scaling up services to meet the needs of PWUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. By studying two independent structures in France and in the USA sharing similar objectives (remote HR), we showed that this approach can be a key solution to crises that impact classical HR structures despite various differences in operating procedures between countries.',\n",

We conducted five in-depth digital co-design workshops with 31 workers employed in alcohol and other drug and urgent care settings.

First, there is a need to provide comprehensive information to meet the information needs of a diverse group of workers with varying knowledge levels, while also designing alerts to be clear, concise, and relevant to the work of individuals. Second, it is important that alerts do not create 'information overload'; however, it is also important that information should be available to those who want it. Third, alert design and dissemination must be perceived to be credible, to avoid 'alert scepticism'; however, credibility is challenging to develop in a broader context of criminalisation, stigmatisation, and sensationalism. Fourth, alerts must be carefully designed to achieve 'intended effects' and avoid unintended effects, while acknowledging that it is impossible to control all potential effects. Finally, while alerts may be intended for an audience of health\\xa0and community workers, people who use drugs are the end-users and must be kept front of mind in the design process. The co-design process revealed complexities in designing drug alerts, particularly in the context of stigmatised illicit drug use, workforce diversity, and dissemination strategies.

Despite the important role of perceived social support in adolescents' PSMU has been examined, possible different influences between perceived support from family and friends are still unknown. To address the gap, the present study aimed to examine how perceived support from family and friends is associated differently with PSMU and the mediating roles of resilience and loneliness therein. A sample of 1056 adolescents was recruited to complete standard questionnaires. Mediation analysis showed that resilience and loneliness mediated this association partially between perceived support from family and PSMU but totally between perceived support from friends and PSMU. Further, ANOVA-based analysis showed that influences of perceived support from family and friends on PSMU were mutually independent, and there was no interaction between them. Our results not only highlight different and independent impacts of perceived support from family and friends on PSMU, but also clarify the mediating mechanisms linking perceived social support to adolescent PSMU.\",\n",

The current study explores stakeholders' perspectives on the feasibility and acceptability of VMHR in Philadelphia. From October 2021 to February 2022, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with potential end users, staff, and leadership at a local federally qualified health center, and community members. Trained coders extracted themes from interview transcripts across four key domains: materials and logistics, location, access, and community introduction. Interviewees from all stakeholder groups endorsed using VMHR to provide supplies for wound care, fentanyl test strips, naloxone, and materials to connect individuals to treatment and other services. Dispensing syringes and medications for opioid use disorder were commonly endorsed by health center staff but were more controversial among potential end users. Even within stakeholder groups, views varied with respect to where to locate the machines, but most agreed that the machine should be placed in the highest drug use areas. Across stakeholder groups, interviewees suggested several strategies to introduce and gain community acceptance of VMHR, including community education, one-on-one conversations with community members, and coupling the machine with safe disposal of syringes and information to link individuals to treatment. Stakeholders were generally receptive to VMHR. The current study findings are consistent with qualitative analyses from outside of the USA and contribute new ideas regarding the anticipated community response and best methods for introducing these machines to a community. With thoughtful planning and design, VMHR could be a feasible and acceptable modality to reduce death and disease transmission associated with the opioid and HIV epidemics in cities like Philadelphia.\",\n",

The associated stigma remains a challenge for individuals living with HIV and children and adolescents face the additional challenge of withstanding the peer, pubertal and identity challenges associated with growing up. The current systematic review aimed to define and explore the major stigma-related challenges of children and adolescents from their own perspectives. A secondary aim was to identify any challenges distinct to childhood and adolescence. Studies included individuals aged 3 to 18 years who were aware of their status. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis was conducted on the included studies. Five analytic themes emerged describing major stigma-related challenges: disclosure-related anxiety, medication adherence, feelings of abnormality, mental health issues and social exclusion. Disclosure-related anxiety and feelings of abnormality appeared to be largely confined to the experience of children and adolescents. Many of the themes centred around peer influence, highlighting the need to belong in youth. Results suggest that youth require tailored interventions targeting their age-specific challenges.',\n",

This study captures the experiences of Ontario PSP in their RTW journeys, including with employers, WSIB, and HCPs. A survey-based study was conducted, using email and social media platforms to distribute the survey to PSP across Ontario. Quantitative data were summarized using means and frequencies, and open text results were analyzed using qualitative framework analysis. 145 survey respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. On a scale out of 5, PSP rated their experience with WSIB and employer support as poor on their first RTW attempt with an average rating of 2.93 and 2.46 respectively. The top three HCPs accessed by PSP were psychologists (61%), occupational therapists (OT; 60%) and general practitioners (GP; 44%). Respondents identified the cultural competence of HCPs in understanding their work demands and work culture as very important. To improve RTW experiences for PSP who make a workers compensation claim for a psychological injury, an increase in HCP cultural competence related to PSP work is indicated, as well as improved RTW processes and workplace support.',\n",

This study aimed to examine data from an integrated sexual health services center to understand the relationship between the intention to reduce chemsex behavior and chemsex-related utilization of mental health services among GBMSM who engage in chemsex. We used data collected from Healing, Empowerment, Recovery of Chemsex (HERO), an integrated health center in Taiwan, between November 2017 and December 2021. As the baseline, clients were asked to rate the current and ideal proportions of their sexual activities that involved the use of MDMA, ketamine, methamphetamine, GHB/GBL, or mephedrone. Having the intention to reduce chemsex was defined as having a lower proportion of ideal engagement compared to actual engagement. The data on the use of the services provided at HERO were linked to the survey responses and compared to information gathered during regular follow-up visits. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses and a Poisson regression analysis were performed on the data. A total of 152 GBMSM reported engaging in chemsex, of whom 105 (69.1%) expressed the intention to reduce their chemsex behavior. Service utilization ranged from 23.0% for participating in meetings of a chemsex recovery group, 17.1% for visiting a mental health clinic, and 10.5% for using both of these services. The intention to reduce chemsex behavior significantly associated with visiting a mental health clinic (aOR\\u2009=\\u20094.68, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05), but its association with attending meetings of a chemsex recovery group was only marginally significant (aOR\\u2009=\\u20092.96, p\\u2009<\\u20090.1).

We examined the proportion of TGD youth who reported each of these outcomes and within-group differences by gender identity and race/ethnicity using descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and predicted probabilities. When differences were examined by gender identity, barriers to equitable care were consistently more present among transgender females than youth of other gender identities. There were few significant differences by race/ethnicity; however, dual referent models demonstrated barriers to equitable care were particularly evident among Black and Hispanic transgender women.

Given the association of PLEs with a broad number of mental health diagnoses, these experiences serve as an important malleable target for early preventive interventions. However, little is known about these experiences across childhood. While these experiences may be common, longitudinal measurement in non-clinical settings is not. Therefore, in order to explore longitudinal trajectories of PLEs in childhood, we harmonized three school-based randomized control trials with longitudinal follow-up to identify heterogeneity in trajectories of these experiences. In an integrative data analysis (IDA) using growth mixture modeling, we identified three latent trajectory classes. One trajectory class was characterized by persistent PLEs, one was characterized by high initial probabilities but improving across the analytic period, and one was characterized by no reports of PLEs. Compared to the class without PLEs, those in the improving class were more likely to be male and have higher levels of aggressive and disruptive behavior at baseline. In addition to the substantive impact this work has on PLE research, we also discuss the methodological innovation as it relates to IDA.

Amid this movement toward health equity, there has been a natural gravitation to community organizing, which has long worked to produce more equitable systems and policies. Community organizing builds power through cycles of listening, participatory research, collective action, and reflection. One manifestation of this power is that organizing initiatives can often influence which issues are up for public debate, and the terms of those debates. This dimension of community power is often described by practitioners as narrative change work, and involves intervening on, complicating, and resisting dominant societal narratives that hinder action on the systems that perpetuate inequity. This article reports results from a study of organizing initiatives in Detroit, MI and Cincinnati, OH which both engaged in intentional narrative change work around health and health equity. We analyzed data from interviews with 35 key leaders across both cities. Results describe the organizational processes and activities taking place in both sites, with an emphasis on one issue in each city: educational equity in Cincinnati and water equity in Detroit. We then use coded interview data to examine how narrative change work took place in organizing around these issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, a challenging time for organizing initiatives. Results provide insights into adaptations taking place in community organizing during this time, as well as various approaches to narrative change work as part of holistic efforts to build and exercise community power to alter social determinants of health.',\n",

Therefore, biofeedback based on subjective symptom scales, objective speech, and physiological features to evaluate efficacy provides a new approach for early screening and treatment of emotional problems in college students. A 4-week, randomized, controlled, parallel biofeedback therapy study was conducted with college students with symptoms of anxiety or depression. Speech samples, physiological samples, and clinical symptoms were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment, and the extracted speech features and physiological features were used for between-group comparisons and correlation analyses between the biofeedback and wait-list groups.

These associations were higher among respondents who specifically named xylazine and those who used fentanyl more frequently, but fentanyl frequency did not fully explain the heightened associations with xylazine effects. This study provides insight into the scope of xylazine exposure and associated health concerns among community-based PWID and suggests measures that may be instrumental for urgently needed research.',\n",

We first document employment and earnings gaps associated with specific impairments and activity limitations using 2017-2021 American Community Survey and 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation data. We then use accommodations data from the 2012, 2019, and 2021 Current Population Survey (CPS) Disability Supplements to examine employment and earnings growth for people with disabilities related both to any, and to technology-based, accommodations. We also provide short descriptions of three developing assistive technologies that assist people with upper body impairments, visual impairments, and anxiety conditions. Almost all impairments and activity limitations are linked to lower employment and earnings, with especially low employment among people with mobility impairments and particularly low earnings among those with cognitive impairments. About one-tenth of workers with disabilities received any accommodations, and 3-4% received equipment-based accommodations in the 2012-2021 period; these figures increased slightly over the period. The occupations with the highest disability accommodations rates had greater disability employment growth from 2012 to 2021, but disability pay gaps did not decrease more in these occupations. The three developing assistive technologies we describe illustrate the potential to reduce the estimated employment and earnings deficits. Assistive technology accommodations have potential for improving employment outcomes for people with disabilities.',\n",

We aimed to investigate the HIV-related knowledge, perceived risks, attitudes, and risk behaviours among multi-ethnic urban-dwelling older adults in Malaysia. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted among 320 adults aged 50 years and above residing in urban Klang Valley, Malaysia. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling in the community and in the outpatient clinics and pharmacy of University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia, from April 2021 to January 2022. The median (IQR) age of participants was 58 (55-64) and 42.5% were males. The median (IQR) knowledge score was 10 (8-12) out of 14. Significant knowledge gaps were noted and ethnic Chinese, higher education levels and better HIV-related attitudes were associated with better scores. The median (IQR) attitude score was 49 (41-55) out of 65. Ethnic Chinese and Indian, knowing people living with HIV (PLHIV), and better HIV-related knowledge were associated with better attitude scores. Many (43.8%) older adults were sexually active however rates of consistent condom use was low (19%) and the majority (89.9%) of participants had low self-perceived risk of HIV. These findings highlight underlying drivers for HIV transmission and delayed treatment among older adults in Malaysia and indicate a need for targeted HIV prevention programs for this population.',\n",

In-depth interviews were conducted with 47 RTWCs across Canada in 2018-2019. We used critical discourse analysis to analyze the way coordinators viewed workers in the complex, multi-stakeholder system of RTW. We identified four ways that RTWCs positioned themselves relative to workers: as trust builders, experts, detectives and motivators. These roles reflected RTWCs position within the system; however, their discourse also contributed to the construction of a moral hierarchy that valued worker motivation and framed some workers as attempting to exploit the RTW system. RTWCs' positions of power in the coordination process warrant further investigation of how they exercise judgement and discretion, particularly when the process depends on their ability to weigh evidence and manage cases in what might be seen as an objective and fair manner.\",\n",

Despite ongoing debate, MD is not officially recognized in medical classifications, with differing views on its aetiology. Some link MD to Lyme disease, while others view it as a variant of delusional infestation. The literature suggests both psychiatric and environmental factors may contribute. The manuscript explores the association with substance abuse, psychiatric comorbidities, infectious agents and the role of internet communities in shaping perceptions. MD's impact on quality of life is significant, yet often overlooked. Treatment approaches are varied due to limited evidence, with low-dose antipsychotics being considered effective, but patient beliefs may influence adherence.

The overall characteristics of the studies were extracted and their methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2. An evidence gap map was constructed, highlighting the most frequently reported outcomes by intervention (CRD42023387713). Thirty-three systematic reviews were included. Of these, 14 (42.2%) assessed the impact of needle/syringe exchange programs (NSEP) and 11 (33.3%) examined opioid agonist therapy (OAT). These interventions are likely to be associated with reductions of HIV/HCV incidence (10-40% risk reduction for NSEP; 50-60% for OAT) and sharing injecting paraphernalia (50% for NSEP, 25-85% for OAT), particularly when combined (moderate evidence). Behavioral/educational interventions were assessed in 12 reviews (36.4%) with most authors in favor/partially in favor of the use of these approaches (moderate evidence). Take-home naloxone programs and supervised-injection facilities were each assessed in two studies (6.1%), which reported inconclusive results (limited/inconsistent evidence). Most authors reported high levels of heterogeneity and risk of bias. Other interventions and outcomes were inadequately reported. Most systematic reviews presented low or critically low quality.

An original panel survey was conducted covering the pandemic's first year. Respondents reported their vaccination status, emotions, evaluations of their safety, and predictions about the spread of COVID-19 and the Israeli gross domestic product. Estimates of fixed-effects models using the survey data suggest that being vaccinated affected people's cognitions about their own safety and their emotions but not their expectations regarding the situation in Israel as a whole. In contrast, the vaccination rate in Israel affected only the respondents' expectations about the spread of COVID-19, their own income, and Israel's gross domestic product.

Understanding PWID experiences accessing and using harm reduction services and PrEP will inform strategies to optimize integration that align with PWID needs and priorities. Between May 2021 and March 2023, we conducted semi-structured interviews with PWID in Kampala, Uganda. We recruited participants with and without previous experience accessing harm reduction services and/or PrEP using purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were audio recorded, translated, and transcribed. We used thematic analysis to characterize motivations for uptake of harm reduction and HIV prevention services, and strategies to optimize delivery of needle and syringe programs (NSP), medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and PrEP. We conducted interviews with 41 PWID. Most participants were relatively aware of their personal HIV risk and accurately identified situations that increased risk, including sharing needles and engaging in transactional sex. Despite risk awareness, participants described engaging in known HIV risk behaviors to satisfy immediate drug use needs. All reported knowledge of harm reduction services, especially distribution of sterile needles and syringes, and many reported having experience with MOUD. Participants who had accessed MOUD followed two primary trajectories; limited resources and relationships with other PWID caused them to discontinue treatment while desire to regain something they believed was lost to their drug use motivated them to continue. Overall, PrEP knowledge among participants was limited and few reported ever taking PrEP. However, participants supported integrating PrEP into harm reduction service delivery and advocated for changes in how these services are accessed. Stigma experienced in healthcare facilities and challenges acquiring money for transportation presented barriers to accessing current facility-based harm reduction and HIV prevention services. Meeting the HIV prevention needs of PWID in Uganda will require lowering barriers to access, including integrated delivery of PrEP and harm reduction services and bringing services directly to communities.

Sub-populations with the largest year-on-year increases were 15-24-year-olds (5.0-pp) and Hispanic respondents (5.1-pp), with interaction (young Hispanic respondents\\u2009=\\u200912.8-pp). On the relative scale, these numbers correspond to 3.2%, 7.2%, 7.3% and 18.7%, respectively. Absolute increases were concentrated among partners reported as HIV-negative. Multivariable analyses for CAS initiation found effects concentrated among Hispanic and White youth and residents of fringe counties of large metropolitan areas. CAS partner number increases were similarly predicted by Hispanic identity and young age. Although condom use remains more common than PrEP use, increasing CAS among MSM not on PrEP suggests potential new HIV transmission pathways. Concentration of increases among 18-24-year-old MSM portends future increases in the proportion of newly diagnosed HIV that occur among youth. Concentration among young Hispanic MSM will likely expand existing disparities. Although reducing barriers to PrEP remains vital, condom promotion for MSM remains a key public health practice and appears to be missing key audiences.

Although coinciding with the import of low cost, high potency and purity methamphetamine, the relationship between supply and demand in propelling this polydrug use is not well understood. We consider the influence of macro changes in supply on the uptake of opioid and methamphetamine co-use by injection at the level of individual drug and injection initiation in West Virginia, a state which leads the US in drug overdose mortality. We recruited n\\u2009=\\u200930 people for semi-structured interviews who self-reported injecting heroin/fentanyl and using methamphetamine by any route at a West Virginia syringe service program and through snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded and transcripts analyzed using a thematic approach. Ethnographic observation was also conducted and recorded in fieldnotes. Sequence of substance and mode of use initiation and use trajectories for opioids and stimulants were charted for each participant. A clear pattern of individual drug initiation emerged that matched each successive supply wave of the US overdose epidemic: 25 participants had initiated opioid use with pills, followed by heroin, often mixed with/replaced by fentanyl, and subsequently added methamphetamine use. For participants, the supply and consumption of opioid analgesics had set in motion a series of steps leading to the addition of stimulant injection to existing opioid injecting repertoires. Unlike other studies that have found a birth cohort effect in patterns of initiation, participants showed the same sequence across age groups. Considerations of economy, availability, dependence, tolerance and the erosion of taboos that marked transitions from opioid pills to heroin injection influenced these subsequent trajectories in novel ways. The form, timing and extent of opioid and stimulant consumption was influenced by four stages of the changing drug supply, which in turn reflected back on demand. Transformations in the social meaning and supply of methamphetamine enabled these transitions while other desired, non-injectable drugs were difficult to obtain. We discuss policy implications of injectable drugs' market dominance at this location and possible interventions.\",\n",

Though recommendations exist to guide the execution and interpretation of preliminary studies, these assume optimal scenarios which may clash with realities faced by researchers. The purpose of this study was to explore how principal investigators (PIs) balance expectations when conducting preliminary studies. We surveyed PIs funded by the National Institutes of Health to conduct preliminary behavioral interventions between 2000 and 2020. Four hundred thirty-one PIs (19% response rate) completed the survey (November 2021 to January 2022, 72% female, mean 21 years post-terminal degree). Most PIs were aware of translational models and believed preliminary studies should precede larger trials but also believed a single preliminary study provided sufficient evidence to scale. When asked about the relative importance of preliminary efficacy (i.e. changes in outcomes) and feasibility (i.e. recruitment, acceptance/adherence) responses varied. Preliminary studies were perceived as necessary to successfully compete for research funding, but among PIs who had peer-reviewed federal-level grants applications (n = 343 [80%]), responses varied about what should be presented to secure funding. Confusion surrounding the definition of a successful, informative preliminary study poses a significant challenge when developing behavior interventions. This may be due to a mismatch between expectations surrounding preliminary studies and the realities of the research enterprise in which they are conducted. To improve the quality of preliminary studies and advance the field of behavioral interventions, additional funding opportunities, more transparent criteria in grant reviews, and additional training for grant reviewers are suggested. Initial testing of behavioral interventions can provide valuable information about the methods of the intervention and whether it is effective. However, recommendations that provide researchers with guidance on how to best conduct pilot studies assume ideal circumstances. The mismatch between what can be realistically accomplished in a preliminary study, and what researchers expect from preliminary studies creates confusion. As a result, it is difficult for researchers to judge the quality, relevance, and potential of preliminary studies. This study suggests more research funding opportunities, clearer rules for reviewing grant applications, and more training for the people who review these applications could help improve preliminary studies and create more effective health behavior programs.',\n",

       " 'W4392928283': 'Prior research into bystander responses to hate speech has utilized variable-centered analyses - such approaches risk simplifying the complex nature of bystander behaviors. Hence, the present study used a person-centered analysis to investigate latent hate speech bystander profiles. In addition, individual and classroom-level correlates associated with the various profiles were studied. The sample included 3225 students in grades 7-9 (51.7% self-identified as female; 37.2% with immigrant background) from 215 classrooms in Germany and Switzerland. The latent profile analysis revealed that four distinct profiles could be distinguished: Passive Bystanders (34.2%), Defenders (47.3%), Revengers (9.8%), and Contributors (8.6%). Multilevel logistic regression models showed common and distinct correlates. For example, students who believed that certain social groups are superior were more likely to be Revengers and Contributors than Passive Bystanders, students who felt more connected with teachers were more likely to be Defenders, and students who were more open to diversity were less likely to be Contributors than Passive Bystanders. Students were less likely Defenders and more likely Revengers and Contributors than Passive Bystanders in classrooms with high rates of hate speech perpetration. Further, in classrooms with high hate speech intervention, students were more likely to be Defenders and less likely to be Contributors than Passive Bystanders. In classrooms with stronger cohesion, students were more likely to be Defenders and less likely to be Contributors than Passive Bystanders. In conclusion, the findings add to our understanding of bystander profiles concerning racist hate speech and the relevance of individual and classroom-level factors in explaining various profiles of bystander behavior.',\n",

Results identified mixed findings for program impact, with variations in outcomes that can help guide future youth-led prevention program initiatives. Youth attending a large \"kick-off\" leadership retreat (that was less youth-led that subsequent smaller retreats) later reported more bystander behaviors, but also reported increased perpetration and victimization, compared to non-attending youth. However, youth attending smaller, more focused leadership retreats held during the school year, reported reductions in sexual harassment perpetration and improved bystander behaviors and attitudes compared to non-attending youth. Evaluation of moderator variables suggests that program impact was generally stronger for younger participants, sexual minority youth, and non-White youth (which were largely Native American youth in this sample).

We explored the within-person associations of three components of emotional responses to everyday stressors, indexed by negative affect, reactivity (initial response to a stressor), recovery (persistence of the post-stressor response), and pile-up (accumulation of stress episodes), with sleep indicators. We conducted coordinated analyses of data in several studies employing ecological momentary assessments, which captured naturally occurring, self-reported stress and sleep. We defined proximal reactivity as the emotional response to the stressor moment in question compared to an immediate pre-stressor state, and distal reactivity as the emotional response to the stressor moment in question compared to a typical stressor-free state for that person. Results in two of three studies showed that people reported significantly lower sleep quality following days on which they experienced higher levels of distal reactivity to stressors. Days with greater distal reactivity also predicted significantly more difficulty falling asleep in one of two studies. There was no clear association between proximal reactivity and subsequent sleep. Associations of recovery or pile-up with subsequent sleep emerged only in single studies. Poorer sleep quality was significantly related to higher next day levels of negative affect in all three studies, but there were no consistent relations between sleep and next day stress reactivity, recovery, or pile-up. These exploratory analyses suggest that distal reactivity is associated with a heightened risk of experiencing poor sleep quality the following night, and as such the former may serve as a candidate for potential targets for the remediation of the negative effects of stress on sleep.',\n",

The intervention group had better adherence (at 24-months) (Contrast=-0.28; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.004), higher school enrolment (OR\\u2009=\\u20092.18; 95% CI:1.30, 3.66); reported savings OR\\u2009=\\u20092.03 (1.29, 3.18) and higher savings (Contrast\\u2009=\\u20090.40; 95% CI:0.10, 0.70) than controls at 48-months. The EE intervention was efficacious in improving adherence, school enrolment, and economic outcomes creating opportunities for improved overall health among adolescents living with HIV.',\n",
       " 'W4224057144': 'People who use drugs (PWUD) are at high risk of experiencing indirect harms of measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19, given high reliance on services and social networks. This study aimed to document short-term changes in behaviours and health-related indicators among PWUD in Montreal, Canada following declaration of a provincial health emergency in Quebec. We administered a structured rapid assessment questionnaire to members of an existing cohort of PWUD and individuals reporting past-year illicit drug use recruited via community services. Telephone and in-person interviews were conducted in May-June and September-December 2020. Participants were asked to report on events and changes since the start of the health emergency (March 13, 2020). Descriptive analyses were performed. A total of 227 participants were included (77% male, median age\\u2009=\\u200946, 81% Caucasian). 83% and 41% reported past six-month illicit drug use and injection drug use, respectively. 70% of unstably housed participants reported increased difficulty finding shelter since the start of the health emergency. 48% of opioid agonist treatment recipients had discussed strategies to avoid treatment disruptions with providers; 22% had missed at least one dose. Many participants perceived increased difficulty accessing non-addiction health care services. Adverse changes were also noted in indicators pertaining to income, drug markets, drug use frequency, and exposure to violence; however, many participants reported no changes in these areas. Among persons reporting past six-month injection drug use, 79% tried to access needle-syringe programmes during the health emergency; 93% of those obtained services. 45% tried to access supervised injection sites, of whom 71% gained entry. This snapshot suggests mixed impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on PWUD in Montreal in the months following declaration of a provincial health emergency. There were signals of increased exposure to high-risk environments as well as deteriorations in access to health services. Pandemic-related measures may have lasting impacts among vulnerable subgroups; continued monitoring is warranted.',\n",
       " 'W4225280418': 'In the context of the current U.S. injection drug use epidemic, targeted public health harm reduction strategies have traditionally focused on overdose prevention and reducing transmission of blood-borne viral infections. Severe bacterial infections (SBI) associated with intravenous drug use have been increasing in frequency in the U.S. over the last decade. This qualitative study aims to identify the risk factors associated with SBI in hospitalized individuals with recent injection drug use. Qualitative analysis (n\\u2009=\\u200915) was performed using an in-depth, semi-structured interview of participants admitted to Bellevue Hospital, NYC, with SBI and recent history of injection drug use. Participants were identified through a referral from either the Infectious Diseases or Addition Medicine consultative services. Interviews were transcribed, descriptively coded, and analyzed for key themes. Participants reported a basic understanding of prevention of blood-borne viral transmission but limited understanding of SBI risk. Participants described engagement in high risk injection behaviors prior to hospitalization with SBI. These practices included polysubstance use, repetitive tissue damage, nonsterile drug diluting water and multipurpose use of water container, lack of hand and skin hygiene, re-use of injection equipment, network sharing, and structural factors leading to an unstable drug injection environment. Qualitative analysis led to the proposal of an Ecosocial understanding of SBI risk, detailing the multi-level interplay between individuals and their social and physical environments in producing risk for negative health outcomes. Structural factors and injection drug use networks directly impact drug use, injection drug use practices, and harm reduction knowledge, ultimately resulting in tissue damage and inoculation of bacteria into the host and subsequent development of SBI. Effective healthcare and community prevention efforts targeted toward reducing risk of bacterial infections could prevent long-term hospitalizations, decrease health care expenditures, and reduce morbidity and mortality.',\n",
       " 'W4280548935': 'Recent studies have found bi-directional relations between stress and sleep. However, few studies have examined the daily associations between stress and electroencephalography (EEG) measured sleep. This study examined the temporal associations between repeated ecological momentary assessments of stress and EEG-estimated sleep. Ninety-eight international or interstate undergraduate students (Mage = 20.54 ± 1.64, 76.5% female, 84.7% Asian) reported their stress levels four times daily at morning awakening, afternoon, evening, and pre-bedtime across 15 consecutive days (>4,000 total observations). Next-day stress was coded as an average of morning, afternoon, and evening stress. Z-Machine Insight+ recorded over 1,000 nights EEG total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency (SE), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration. Multilevel models, adjusted for covariates (i.e., sociodemographic, health factors, and daily covariates) and lagged outcomes, tested the daily within- and between-level stress-sleep associations. After adjusting for covariates, within-person shorter TST (b = -0.11 [-0.21, -0.01], p = .04), lower SE (b = -0.02 [-0.03, 0.00], p = .04), less SWS (b = -0.38 [-0.66, -0.10], p = .008), and less REM sleep (b = -0.32 [-0.53, -0.10], p = .004) predicted higher next-day stress. Pre-bedtime stress did not predict same-night sleep. No significant results emerged at the between-person level. These findings demonstrate that poor or short sleep, measured by EEG, is predictive of higher next-day stress. Results for sleep architecture support the role of SWS and REM sleep in regulating the perception of stress. Given that only within-person effects were significant, these findings highlight the importance of examining night-to-night fluctuations in sleep affecting next-day stress and its impact on daytime functioning.',\n",
       " 'W4280563595': 'Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States will require most Americans to vaccinate against the disease. However, considerable research suggests that a significant proportion of Americans intend to forego vaccination, putting pandemic recovery at risk. Republicans are one of the largest groups of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant individuals. Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy within this group is vital to ending the pandemic. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of messages from co-partisan sources in reducing vaccine hesitancy. In a large (N\\u2009=\\u20093000) and demographically representative survey, we find that exposing \"Middle-of-the-Road\" partisans to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan source cues reduces vaccine hesitancy. However, for those who identify as \"Strong\" or \"Weak\" partisans, we find no statistically significant differences in vaccination intentions when exposed to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan sources. We conclude by discussing how our findings are helpful for vaccine communication efforts.'}"
